# Multi-Step Form

Multi-Step Form is a project developed using Vue.js, providing an interactive and multi-step form creation experience. This project offers users a step-by-step approach to fill out forms, making large and complex forms more manageable.

## Features:

  - The form follows a step-by-step structure.
  - Users input necessary information in each step and progress to the next.

- **Validation and Navigation:**
  - User input is validated at each step.
  - Users can navigate back to the previous step or proceed to the next one.

- **Live Validation:**
  - User input is dynamically validated in real-time.
  - Errors are instantly provided as feedback to the user.

- **Enhanced Visuals:**
  - Transitions between each step and the overall form appearance are carefully designed to enhance the user experience.

- **Data Storage:**
  - Entered data is temporarily stored using local storage in the browser.
  - Data is preserved even when the browser is closed or the page is refreshed.

## Technologies:
